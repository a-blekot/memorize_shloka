## Memorize Shlokas: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Memorize Shlokas app for Android/IOs!

This is an open source app developed by Aleksey Blekot. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by you and stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Aleksey Blekot.  
Kyiv, Ukraine.
